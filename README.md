# Solidworks Macros

This repo is a list of Solidworks macros I have created to help with the design process.
I have attached compiled/ready to use *.swp files as well as *.bas files that allow to view the code.

Auto name and save <-- will immediately save the file using common properties "number - description". Very useful as you can type those information once in common properties, and it will be used across the project, for example in drawing tables, BOM's, PDM.

Draft Flat Prefix <-- this macro will work only with drafts and it is design to copy the name of part/assembly on the draft and add Flat in front of the name. This is used in a technique that helps to rapidly generate DXF files for sheet metal parts and other parts cut in 2D. This macro is used to save a draft of sheet part in flat view in 1:1 scale (recommending preset template). Thanks to that all parts requiring DXF files will have 2 drawings, one regular with your bends, dimensions, welds, etc. and the other one with only flat view. This makes the whole set linked and easy to update/revise, easy to grab and spot in Windows explorer, and a new set of DXF's can be generated by using Solidworks task scheduler in minutes.
