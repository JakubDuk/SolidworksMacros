# Solidworks Macros

This repo is a list of Solidworks macros I have created to help with the design process.
I have attached compiled/ready to use *.swp files as well as *.bas files that allow to view the code.

Auto name and save <-- will immediately save the file using common properties "number - description". Very useful as you can type those information once in common properties, and it will be used across the project, for example in drawing tables, BOM's, PDM.
